## Status
The Mekabiz-Autoclicker project is in its initial development phase, with the core functionality of the autoclicker implemented.

## Context
The project requires a user interface to allow users to customize the autoclicker settings, including the click interval, hotkeys, and other features. The development team has decided to use HTML to create the user interface.

## Decision
Use HTML to create a settings panel for the Mekabiz-Autoclicker Chrome extension, allowing users to customize the autoclicker settings, including:
- Click interval input field
- Hotkey selection dropdown
- Toggle button for enabling/disabling the autoclicker
- Save button to save the custom settings

## Consequences
The decision to use HTML for the settings panel will allow for a simple and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to customize the autoclicker settings. This will also enable the development team to focus on implementing the core functionality of the autoclicker, while providing a user-friendly experience for the users. Additionally, using HTML will make it easier to integrate the settings panel with the rest of the Chrome extension, as it is a standard web technology.
